# StyStatic's Moon Mod

The Moon Mod is a mod that I created as a small child, it offers nothing of value, but adds a few new pieces of gear and a few new utility blocks; I don't recommend playing with it, but the source is public as a learning experience.

**Any bad grammar is because it was created at a young age. I WILL NOT BE FIXING IT; THIS MOD IS AVAILABLE AS A TOOL TO LEARN FROM, NOTHING ELSE**

I also didn't know C# when I wrote this, and still don't.
